# Anvil Error Tracker

This project allows you to collect and track any errors in your app. It comes with a dashboard for better analyzing and monitoring your errors. It is built for [Anvil](https://anvil.works?utm_source=github:app_README), the framework for building web apps with nothing but Python.

## Features

* Group same errors, merge similar errors and maintain a timeline of any updates and occurrences for it.
* Mark any error as fixed or ignore the ones that donâ€™t need to be fixed.
* See details for any error including the detailed traceback, users facing it, device details for users, link to session logs, etc.
* Keep a track of errors that were previously fixed but had reappeared.
* Filter, search and sort errors. You can also search by email to see errors faced by a user
* Allows multiple users to collaborate
